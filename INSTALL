FreeBSD Installation
--------------------

FreeBSD users please use the sysutils/zfs-snapshot-mgmt port:

  cd /usr/ports/sysutils/zfs-snapshot-mgmt
  make install clean

and follow the instructions printed after installation.

See the manpage for details:

  man zfs-snapshot-mgmt



Manual Installation
-------------------

Requirements:
  Ruby
  (/usr/local/bin/ruby, edit the first line of script for a different path)

Copy the zfs-snapshot-mgmt script to /usr/local/bin.
Copy the zfs-snapshot-mgmt.conf.sample file to
/usr/local/etc/zfs-snapshot-mgmt.conf (this path is hardcoded in the script,
sorry. You may change it manually (grep for CONFIG_FILE)).
Copy the zfs-snapshot-mgmt.8 file to man8 directory on your system (usually
/usr/local/share/man/man8/ or just /usr/share/man/man8/).

Read the manual page (man zfs-snapshot-mgmt).

Edit the zfs-snapshot-mgmt.conf file.
Add the script to crontab (usually /etc/crontab but may differ on your system),
append a line like this:

*/5  *  *  *  *         root            /usr/local/bin/zfs-snapshot-mgmt

From now on the snapshots will be automatically created.
